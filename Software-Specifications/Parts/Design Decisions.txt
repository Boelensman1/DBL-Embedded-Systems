/Feeder constantly on
The feeder in constantly on because of priority 2, speed, mentioned in the Machine Design document. Another reason is that there's a turning part that needs to spin through to get to it's initial position to be able to deposit discs again. 

/Lens lamp position
We chose to have the lens lamp for position sensor constantly on, because it's easier to code resulting in spending less time on it. The optimilasation is minimal if we would turn them off everytime there's a gap between discs, because of the feeder being quite fast in depositing the next disc. 

/Conveyor Belt
The conveyor belt is constantly running, because the feeder is constantly pushing discs onto the conveyor belt. This goes hand in hand with our second priority, which is speed.

/Lens lamp colour
Like with the position sensor, it's easier to code that it is continuously on. The light being off if it's possible, would again be a minimal improvement, because the gaps between discs being pushed on the conveyer belt is the same as with the black white detector. 

/Push button
We use the push button, because of priority 1, correctness, to know if the sorter arm is at its highest point. We need to know this, because we need to know when to stop the motor making the sorter arm going up.

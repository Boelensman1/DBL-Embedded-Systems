/Process part
	-	Comparing numbers from Logbooks and the Work Plan
		-	Draw conclusion (Work Plan or execution wrong and check if planned time was spent by each group member)
	-	Group reflection (Maarten mailed Van der Woude about this, because he didn't know what this had to be. He should have cc'ed. )
	
/Validation and testing
	-	References
	
/Final Report
	-	Changes (or did we decide to not do this?)

The machine was tested in real life, during the tests the behavior was according to the USE-cases(Machine Design). The machine booted up, it started once the START/STOP button was pressed and stopped when the START/STOP button was pressed again and the last disc on the conveyer belt was sorted. When the ABORT button was pressed during the running phase the plastic wear halted immediately. The display outputted correctly every state in which the machine was, during the tests the discs were sorted properly and  when there were no more discs left, the machine stopped after under 4 seconds. The machine was then powered off with no difficulty.

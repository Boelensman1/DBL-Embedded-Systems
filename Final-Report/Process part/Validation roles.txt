In the table, we see the group members that were intended to fulfil the roles during the weeks, according to our Work Plan. It is clear that in week 4, there were some difficulties regarding the roles of the president and secretary. However, starting from week 5, everything went smoothly. We had originally planned that there would be no meetings after week 8, but because we didn't consider the fact that there would not be a second meeting in week 8 because of Good Friday, we had requested another meeting in week 9. The quality assurance managers and materials manager found no difficulties at all.
